## What makes a good LLM eval?

Spring Break is finally here and I wanted to do some research on something that's been on my mind for the past
month, ever since Dwarkesh Patel's Podcast episode with Sholto Douglas and Trenton Bricken. I wanted to have fun and make my own
benchmark; just for kicks, without overly complex strategies. Just make something abstract
that no one has thought about yet, like evaluating an LLM on their ability to come up with convincing philosophical claims
in a few-shot environment. But I ended up realizing that there is not much blog posts/videos/condensed sources on what
even makes a good eval. So, this blog summarizes my findings.

There is a lot of discussons and an increasing
need for more comphrehensive benchmarks that evaluate the capabilities of continuously more sophisticated models we use today.
Subsequently, the shortcomings of current benchmarks, particularly what they evaluate, how they do so and how well they
stay relevant to testing future models calls for a re-evaluation of our benchmarking strategies, incorporating novel metrics that reflect the complexity of modern AI systems. This
would involve developing more nuanced evaluation frameworks that account for the unique strengths and weaknesses of contemporary models, such as
their ability to generalize, adapt to new situations, and operate in uncertain environments. By doing so, we can ensure that future benchmarks
accurately assess the capabilities of increasingly sophisticated AI models, ultimately driving progress towards more effective, efficient, and
reliable artificial intelligence systems.

Unfortunately this is still a developing subset of the AI field. There is much talk around it, not much action and innovation.
Funny to use the word innovation in regards to a testing problem.

I recently saw a cool little Jupyter Notebook that used Claude 3 and a Google Search API to generate reports on a topic.
After generating queries, it makes loop runs, summarizing information it found, to then critique it and fill in the gaps
by making another round of queries, with all the previous context consequently fed back into it.
I've been in love with Opus and have switched from GPT4 on the day of its release, but was not aware of how good it actually is
at tasks such as this one.

This is the final report of what the AI-researcher was able to find. At this point, the input token count reached 90,000+.
You could say I spent some ($1) money on this blog.

# Key Characteristics of Effective Evaluation Benchmarks

## Introduction

Evaluation benchmarks are an essential component of any effective evaluation system. They serve as standards or measures against which the performance, quality, or progress of an intervention, program, or system can be assessed. Effective evaluation benchmarks possess several key characteristics that contribute to their utility and reliability. This report will explore these essential characteristics in detail.

## Key Characteristics of Effective Evaluation Benchmarks

### 1. Relevance

Effective evaluation benchmarks are closely aligned with the objectives, activities, and intended outcomes of the intervention or program being evaluated. They directly measure the key indicators of success that are most meaningful and important.

### 2. Reliability

Evaluation benchmarks should produce consistent, stable, and dependable results over time. The measurement process should be standardized and replicable, minimizing the influence of external factors or subjective biases.

Benchmarks must accurately and comprehensively capture the construct or phenomenon they are intended to measure. They should have a strong theoretical and empirical basis, and their relationship to the underlying concepts should be well-established.

#### Approaches for Empirically Validating the Construct Validity of Evaluation Benchmarks

The additional search results provide insights on various approaches for empirically validating the construct validity of evaluation benchmarks:

1. **Convergent Validity**: Examine the extent to which the benchmark correlates with other measures that are theoretically related to the same construct.

2. **Discriminant Validity**: Assess the degree to which the benchmark is distinct from measures of unrelated constructs, demonstrating that it is not simply measuring something else.

3. **Nomological Validity**: Evaluate whether the benchmark's relationships with other variables conform to theoretical predictions, providing evidence for the underlying construct.

4. **Factor Analysis**: Use statistical techniques, such as exploratory or confirmatory factor analysis, to examine the benchmark's factor structure and its alignment with the theoretical construct.

5. **Criterion-Related Validity**: Investigate how well the benchmark predicts or is related to a relevant criterion, such as performance outcomes or other established measures.

6. **Longitudinal Studies**: Conduct longitudinal research to assess the stability of the benchmark's relationships over time, further supporting its construct validity.

7. **Experimental Manipulation**: Employ experimental designs to manipulate the construct and observe the benchmark's sensitivity to these changes, providing evidence of its construct validity.

By incorporating these empirical validation approaches, evaluation teams can build a robust case for the construct validity of their evaluation benchmarks, enhancing their credibility and usefulness.

### 4. Specificity

Effective benchmarks are clearly defined, with unambiguous criteria and operational definitions. This ensures that the measurement process is transparent and that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what is being assessed.
