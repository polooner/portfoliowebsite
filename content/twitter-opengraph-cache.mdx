title: Fix Twitter (X) opengraph image cache not refreshing
summary: "Fix Twitter (X) opengraph image cache not refreshing"

If you just want the <strong>TLDR</strong>:

<br />

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>1.</strong> Check that the size of your image is{" "}
    <strong>1200 x 630</strong> and ideally below 1 megabyte (not sure what the
    exact limit is as it is not mentioned anywhere - below this number has
    worked for me)
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    <strong>2.</strong> Change the name of the route of the URL you are trying
    to share to make Twitter think this is a new route
  </li>
</ul> <br />

Opengraph is very easy. Define a route, style the component and we're good. However,
my biggest struggle with opengraph images was X's cache. Once upon a time I was asked
to create an opengraph image for an important URL linking to Julius' blog for a Founding
Product Designer role. The "hardcoded" .png format image and specifying it inside
of the individual route's metadata took 2 minutes. However, I committed a few mistakes
that are barely mentioned anywhere on the web:

<br />

<div className="flex flex-row gap-2">
  <span>-</span>{" "}
  <span>
    Posted the URL beforehand to see how it looks currently. Twitter cached the
    image related to the URL.
  </span>
</div>
<br />
<div className="flex flex-row gap-2">
  <span>-</span>{" "}
  <span>
    Did not check the size of the image. No one cares about opengraph image
    sizes - except for Twitter. I had a <strong>9000(ish) by 7000(ish)</strong>{" "}
    resolution and a total size of about 7 megabytes. Turns out opengraph image
    won't work with Twitter above a certain size. Reducing it to the standard
    opengraph size of <strong>1,200 x 630</strong> did the trick.
  </span>
</div>
<br />

I spent 4 hours trying to hunt down why was it not updating on Twitter. I redeployed the site multiple times after reducing the size of the image. The image finally worked on my dev deployment.
But production still did not show an image. The final boss was to invalidate the cache by renaming my route to something slightly different to create a new cache for a new URL.
