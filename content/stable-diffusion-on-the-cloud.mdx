## Run AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui on the cloud, for (almost) free

Using <a className='underline text-black' href='https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui'> stable-diffusion-webui</a>
requires a lot of power. My Macbook Pro 14 running on 16GB of memory and the (now over 2 years old!)
M1 Pro chip is extremely slow on the tasks that things such as detailing, more steps,
and bigger models like SDXL require. So here is how I've been running automatic1111/webui
on RunPod.io, renting a GPU of my choice hourly.

  HINT ðŸ’¡: To save money, only rent a GPU for really computational tasks, like
  detailers, face swappers, etc. I prefer to use most models on my M1 Pro, which
  only takes a max of 1 minute for even the most realistic models (eg.
<a
    className='underline text-black'
    target='_blank'
    href='https://civitai.com/models/25694/epicrealism'
  > EpiCRealism </a>
  ).

1. Sign in to <a target='_blank' className='underline text-black' href='https://runpod.io?ref=nxzbt93a'>RunPod.io</a>
2. Add any amount you would like, I added **$10** which is enough for A LOT.
3. Go to **_Community Cloud_** (or secure, up to you).
4. Pick a GPU. For reference, a 3090 does most of my ADetailer/Reactor tasks in under a minute (compared to my laptop's hour)
5. Click the **_Search for a template box_**
   {/* 6. Start typing <CopyWord>Stable Diffusion</CopyWord>. */}
6. Start typing **"Stable Diffusion"** and click **"RunPod Stable Diffusion"**:

   <Image src='/images/runpod_sd.png' width={1970 / 2} height={794 / 2}></Image>

7. Customize storage depending to your preference, otherwise click **Continue** &rarr; **Deploy**
   The defaults usually work for me when I use one model and some extras.

8. Once deployed, you are ready to open webui. Click the first button, **HTTP Service [Port 3000]** and then **Jupyter Lab [Port 8888]** to open the notebook.

     src='/images/runpod_started.png'
     width={976 / 2}
     height={554 / 2}
   ></Image>
9. To get the output images, go to the output folder in the notebook app.
