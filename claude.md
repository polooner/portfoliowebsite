## Code style guideliens

Absolutely never write in-line JSX style tags. Try to avoid using in-line style classes if possible. Always write tailwind classes. 
If you find yourself repeating the same LONG class over and over please write either a 1. simple reusable JSX component 2. a tailwind utility class
