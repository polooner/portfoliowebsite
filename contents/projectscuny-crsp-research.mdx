> I have been accepted into City University of New York's Research Scholars Program. How did this happen? I reached out 
> to one of my Computer Science professors for a research opportunity. I was very happy to find one with an 
> impactful subject in an area that I have not explored yet, requiring knowledge of demanding skills and diving into
> the fascinating world of medical technology. 
> \
> \
> This is a year-long project, meaning there will be a lot of time and therefore a number of meaningful developments. 
> We are hoping to revolutionize modern medical image reconstructions with astonishingly efficient and high quality
> computations. Current algorithms are acceptable and reasonably reliable. However, they are still very weak in special 
> cases, i.e., when given the task of scanning an (as defined by medical principles) uncommonly big person.

> Starting from building a foundation of CT Scan algorithms, me, my research peer, and mentor, will expand our knowledge 
> to grasp and  familiarize ourselves with the advanced details of medical image reconstruction. We are hoping to challenge
> the modern calculations, aiming to find the inefficiences and tradeoffs of the widely used standards. From understanding
> the current approaches to such problems, through advanced mathematics, to translating possible improvements into C++
> code, our team is bound to find a groundbreaking change.
