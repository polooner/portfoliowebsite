company: Market Research Series - Ep. 1
title: Announcing Market Research Series, and first part.
messageContent: 'Sharing, improving and practicing my research on different markets.'
---

As an entrepreneur, I aspire to solve problems of any industry, with great impact. I am starting Market Research Series
where I will be researching markets which I could possibly target with new products - developed by me. With lots of heavy consideration beforehand,
I figured this is going to be the best and most accountable way to keep myself constantly developing things. I am extremely
excited to get this started. Through these blog posts I aim to master my skills of detailed analysis, problem solving,
strategic and business thinking. This will not be general breakdowns of mainstream, most heard of elements of the world.
I want to of course start from that, but the point is to keep digging down as deep as possible
\
\
I will be applying existing frameworks and insights that I have learned from successful founders/investors which I really
admire. Outcomes that I aim to get through each research session:

- Understanding deep depths of different industries.
- Recognizing strengths, weaknesses.
- Searching for complex processes that need easing.
- Gathering existing products and finding missing values.
- Finding a problem that I could solve through unique value.
- Gaining investment/finance skills through financial/quantitative analysis of companies within a sector.
- Finding new, unique, unconventional customer bases
- Calculating/estimating the size and value of markets I find. For example, the total value of a market for middle-aged
  professionals looking to switch carrer paths might not have been calculated yet. Or at least not released to the general
  public, as it's 100% an area already named and researched by someone somewhere in the world.
- Receiving potential feedback from readers (yes you, say hi!).
  \

Most of this will be done through Google and social media. Most likely TikTok focused - I've recently found tons of valuable
knowledge coming from so many different areas.

# Art Industry

\
As a creative running on a limited schedule myself, I would love to develop a product that really streamlines and potentially
blooms my creativity/allows for exposure.
Let's dive deeper into the art industry. I would like to start with identifying some general practices:

_- Art galleries display hand-picked art, either from direct inquiries or application processes. They provide a space for
creatives to display their art physically. They take comissions for each sale._

1. Is there a platform for galleries open to applications?
2. Is there a standard for closing deals, such as maybe using a Stripe link?
3. What are the processes that define who and what is picked for display? How many people are involved in such processes,
   how to ensure the success of their picks, other than their lifelong expertise of picking artwork?

_- Promoting art shows to attract potential buyers. Displays usually last less than a month - it is crucial to gain prospects
during that limited time._

1. How/what tools/platforms do they use to put themselves out there?
2. Is there a way to focus on people with a particular style/background which might attract them to particular art work
   with greater magnitude?
   \

- Creatives make their pieces.
  \

1. They need to immerse themselves into their processes to gain the inspiraton they need. This is an indescribable range of
   activities, given it can be as little as being in a quiet room, to collecting memories over a course of several years.

\
Let's stop here for a second. With such a complex, time consuming process that is so different for everyone, putting out work
consistently takes tons of time. What if there was a way to inspire artists through generating art that resembles their own
style with close attention to detail?
