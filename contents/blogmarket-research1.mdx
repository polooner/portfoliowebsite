company: Market Research Series - Ep. 1
title: Announcing Market Research Series, and first part.
messageContent: 'Sharing, improving and practicing my research on different markets.'
---

As an entrepreneur, I aspire to solve problems of any industry, with great impact. I am starting Market Research Series
where I will be researching markets which I could possibly target with new products - developed by me. With lots of heavy consideration beforehand,
I figured this is going to be the best and most accountable way to keep myself constantly developing things. I am extremely
excited to get this started. Through these blog posts I aim to master my skills of detailed analysis, problem solving,
strategic and business thinking. This will not be general breakdowns of mainstream, most heard of elements of the world.
I want to of course start from that, but the point is to keep digging down as deep as possible
\
\
I will be applying existing frameworks and insights that I have learned from successful founders/investors which I really
admire. Outcomes that I aim to get through each research session:

- Understanding deep depths of different industries.
- Recognizing strengths, weaknesses.
- Searching for complex processes that need easing.
- Gathering existing products and finding missing values.
- Finding a problem that I could solve through unique value.
- Gaining investment/finance skills through financial/quantitative analysis of companies within a sector.
- Finding new, unique, unconventional customer bases
- Calculating/estimating the size and value of markets I find. For example, the total value of a market for middle-aged
  professionals looking to switch carrer paths might not have been calculated yet. Or at least not released to the general
  public, as it's 100% an area already named and researched by someone somewhere in the world.
- Receiving potential feedback from readers (yes you, say hi!).
  \

Most of this will be done through Google and social media. Most likely TikTok focused - I've recently found tons of valuable
knowledge coming from so many different areas.
